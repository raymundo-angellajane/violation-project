# Fix for "Call to undefined method App\Http\Controllers\ViolationController::index()"

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] Uncommented and fixed the `index()` method in ViolationController
- [x] Fixed variable naming inconsistency in the `show()` method
- [x] Verified the method returns the correct view with violations data

## Changes Made:
1. **ViolationController.php**:
   - Uncommented the `index()` method that fetches violations and returns the violation-entry view
   - Fixed the `show()` method variable name from `$violations` to `$violation` to match the compact() call

## Testing:
The fix should resolve the error. You can now test by:
1. Running the application
2. Visiting the `/violations` route which should now work properly
3. The violation-entry view should display the list of violations

## Notes:
- The `index()` method uses `Violation::latest()->get()` to fetch violations ordered by latest first
- The view `violation-entry.blade.php` expects a `$violations` variable which is now provided
- All other controller methods (create, store, edit, update, destroy, exportPdf) remain unchanged
